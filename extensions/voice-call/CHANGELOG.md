- Call flows: outbound notify vs. conversation modes, configurable auto‑hangup, and multi‑turn continuation.
- Inbound handling: policy controls (disabled/allowlist/open), allowlist matching, and inbound greeting.
- Webhooks: built‑in server with configurable bind/port/path plus `publicUrl` override.
- Exposure helpers: ngrok + Tailscale serve/funnel; dev‑only signature bypass for ngrok free tier.
- Streaming: OpenAI Realtime STT over media WebSocket with partial + final transcripts.
- Speech: OpenAI TTS (model/voice/instructions) with Twilio `<Say>` fallback.
- Tooling: `voice_call` tool actions for initiate/continue/speak/end/status.
- Gateway RPC: `voicecall.initiate|continue|speak|end|status` (+ legacy `voicecall.start`).
- CLI: `openclaw voicecall` commands (call/start/continue/speak/end/status/tail/expose).
- Observability: JSONL call logs and `voicecall tail` for live inspection.
- Response controls: `responseModel`, `responseSystemPrompt`, and `responseTimeoutMs` for auto‑responses.
