# Microsoft Teams (plugin)

> "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."

Updated: 2026-01-21

Status: text + DM attachments are supported; channel/group file sending requires `sharePointSiteId` + Graph permissions (see [Sending files in group chats](#sending-files-in-group-chats)). Polls are sent via Adaptive Cards.

## Plugin required

Microsoft Teams ships as a plugin and is not bundled with the core install.

**Breaking change (2026.1.15):** MS Teams moved out of core. If you use it, you must install the plugin.

Explainable: keeps core installs lighter and lets MS Teams dependencies update independently.

Install via CLI (npm registry):

```bash
openclaw plugins install @openclaw/msteams
```

Local checkout (when running from a git repo):

```bash
openclaw plugins install ./extensions/msteams
```

If you choose Teams during configure/onboarding and a git checkout is detected,
OpenClaw will offer the local install path automatically.

Details: [Plugins](/plugin)

## Quick setup (beginner)

1. Install the Microsoft Teams plugin.
2. Create an **Azure Bot** (App ID + client secret + tenant ID).
3. Configure OpenClaw with those credentials.
4. Expose `/api/messages` (port 3978 by default) via a public URL or tunnel.
5. Install the Teams app package and start the gateway.

Minimal config:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    msteams: {
      enabled: true,
      appId: "<APP_ID>",
      appPassword: "<APP_PASSWORD>",
      tenantId: "<TENANT_ID>",
      webhook: { port: 3978, path: "/api/messages" },
    },
  },
}
```

Note: group chats are blocked by default (`channels.msteams.groupPolicy: "allowlist"`). To allow group replies, set `channels.msteams.groupAllowFrom` (or use `groupPolicy: "open"` to allow any member, mention-gated).

## Goals

- Talk to OpenClaw via Teams DMs, group chats, or channels.
- Keep routing deterministic: replies always go back to the channel they arrived on.
- Default to safe channel behavior (mentions required unless configured otherwise).

## Config writes

By default, Microsoft Teams is allowed to write config updates triggered by `/config set|unset` (requires `commands.config: true`).

Disable with:

```json5
{
  channels: { msteams: { configWrites: false } },
}
```

## Access control (DMs + groups)

**DM access**

- Default: `channels.msteams.dmPolicy = "pairing"`. Unknown senders are ignored until approved.
- `channels.msteams.allowFrom` accepts AAD object IDs, UPNs, or display names. The wizard resolves names to IDs via Microsoft Graph when credentials allow.

**Group access**

- Default: `channels.msteams.groupPolicy = "allowlist"` (blocked unless you add `groupAllowFrom`). Use `channels.defaults.groupPolicy` to override the default when unset.
- `channels.msteams.groupAllowFrom` controls which senders can trigger in group chats/channels (falls back to `channels.msteams.allowFrom`).
- Set `groupPolicy: "open"` to allow any member (still mention‑gated by default).
- To allow **no channels**, set `channels.msteams.groupPolicy: "disabled"`.

Example:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    msteams: {
      groupPolicy: "allowlist",
      groupAllowFrom: ["user@org.com"],
    },
  },
}
```

**Teams + channel allowlist**

- Scope group/channel replies by listing teams and channels under `channels.msteams.teams`.
- Keys can be team IDs or names; channel keys can be conversation IDs or names.
- When `groupPolicy="allowlist"` and a teams allowlist is present, only listed teams/channels are accepted (mention‑gated).
- The configure wizard accepts `Team/Channel` entries and stores them for you.
- On startup, OpenClaw resolves team/channel and user allowlist names to IDs (when Graph permissions allow)
  and logs the mapping; unresolved entries are kept as typed.

Example:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    msteams: {
      groupPolicy: "allowlist",
      teams: {
        "My Team": {
          channels: {
            General: { requireMention: true },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## How it works

1. Install the Microsoft Teams plugin.
2. Create an **Azure Bot** (App ID + secret + tenant ID).
3. Build a **Teams app package** that references the bot and includes the RSC permissions below.
4. Upload/install the Teams app into a team (or personal scope for DMs).
5. Configure `msteams` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (or env vars) and start the gateway.
6. The gateway listens for Bot Framework webhook traffic on `/api/messages` by default.

## Azure Bot Setup (Prerequisites)

Before configuring OpenClaw, you need to create an Azure Bot resource.

### Step 1: Create Azure Bot

1. Go to [Create Azure Bot](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.AzureBot)
2. Fill in the **Basics** tab:

   | Field              | Value                                                    |
   | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Bot handle**     | Your bot name, e.g., `openclaw-msteams` (must be unique) |
   | **Subscription**   | Select your Azure subscription                           |
   | **Resource group** | Create new or use existing                               |
   | **Pricing tier**   | **Free** for dev/testing                                 |
   | **Type of App**    | **Single Tenant** (recommended - see note below)         |
   | **Creation type**  | **Create new Microsoft App ID**                          |

> **Deprecation notice:** Creation of new multi-tenant bots was deprecated after 2025-07-31. Use **Single Tenant** for new bots.

3. Click **Review + create** → **Create** (wait ~1-2 minutes)

### Step 2: Get Credentials

1. Go to your Azure Bot resource → **Configuration**
2. Copy **Microsoft App ID** → this is your `appId`
3. Click **Manage Password** → go to the App Registration
4. Under **Certificates & secrets** → **New client secret** → copy the **Value** → this is your `appPassword`
5. Go to **Overview** → copy **Directory (tenant) ID** → this is your `tenantId`

### Step 3: Configure Messaging Endpoint

1. In Azure Bot → **Configuration**
2. Set **Messaging endpoint** to your webhook URL:
   - Production: `https://your-domain.com/api/messages`
   - Local dev: Use a tunnel (see [Local Development](#local-development-tunneling) below)

### Step 4: Enable Teams Channel

1. In Azure Bot → **Channels**
2. Click **Microsoft Teams** → Configure → Save
3. Accept the Terms of Service

## Local Development (Tunneling)

Teams can't reach `localhost`. Use a tunnel for local development:

**Option A: ngrok**

```bash
ngrok http 3978
# Copy the https URL, e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io
# Set messaging endpoint to: https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/messages
```

**Option B: Tailscale Funnel**

```bash
tailscale funnel 3978
# Use your Tailscale funnel URL as the messaging endpoint
```

## Teams Developer Portal (Alternative)

Instead of manually creating a manifest ZIP, you can use the [Teams Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/apps):

1. Click **+ New app**
2. Fill in basic info (name, description, developer info)
3. Go to **App features** → **Bot**
4. Select **Enter a bot ID manually** and paste your Azure Bot App ID
5. Check scopes: **Personal**, **Team**, **Group Chat**
6. Click **Distribute** → **Download app package**
7. In Teams: **Apps** → **Manage your apps** → **Upload a custom app** → select the ZIP

This is often easier than hand-editing JSON manifests.

## Testing the Bot

**Option A: Azure Web Chat (verify webhook first)**

1. In Azure Portal → your Azure Bot resource → **Test in Web Chat**
2. Send a message - you should see a response
3. This confirms your webhook endpoint works before Teams setup

**Option B: Teams (after app installation)**

1. Install the Teams app (sideload or org catalog)
2. Find the bot in Teams and send a DM
3. Check gateway logs for incoming activity

## Setup (minimal text-only)

1. **Install the Microsoft Teams plugin**
   - From npm: `openclaw plugins install @openclaw/msteams`
   - From a local checkout: `openclaw plugins install ./extensions/msteams`

2. **Bot registration**
   - Create an Azure Bot (see above) and note:
     - App ID
     - Client secret (App password)
     - Tenant ID (single-tenant)

3. **Teams app manifest**
   - Include a `bot` entry with `botId = <App ID>`.
   - Scopes: `personal`, `team`, `groupChat`.
   - `supportsFiles: true` (required for personal scope file handling).
   - Add RSC permissions (below).
   - Create icons: `outline.png` (32x32) and `color.png` (192x192).
   - Zip all three files together: `manifest.json`, `outline.png`, `color.png`.

4. **Configure OpenClaw**

   ```json
   {
     "msteams": {
       "enabled": true,
       "appId": "<APP_ID>",
       "appPassword": "<APP_PASSWORD>",
       "tenantId": "<TENANT_ID>",
       "webhook": { "port": 3978, "path": "/api/messages" }
     }
   }
   ```

   You can also use environment variables instead of config keys:
   - `MSTEAMS_APP_ID`
   - `MSTEAMS_APP_PASSWORD`
   - `MSTEAMS_TENANT_ID`

5. **Bot endpoint**
   - Set the Azure Bot Messaging Endpoint to:
     - `https://<host>:3978/api/messages` (or your chosen path/port).

6. **Run the gateway**
   - The Teams channel starts automatically when the plugin is installed and `msteams` config exists with credentials.

## History context

- `channels.msteams.historyLimit` controls how many recent channel/group messages are wrapped into the prompt.
- Falls back to `messages.groupChat.historyLimit`. Set `0` to disable (default 50).
- DM history can be limited with `channels.msteams.dmHistoryLimit` (user turns). Per-user overrides: `channels.msteams.dms["<user_id>"].historyLimit`.

## Current Teams RSC Permissions (Manifest)

These are the **existing resourceSpecific permissions** in our Teams app manifest. They only apply inside the team/chat where the app is installed.

**For channels (team scope):**

- `ChannelMessage.Read.Group` (Application) - receive all channel messages without @mention
- `ChannelMessage.Send.Group` (Application)
- `Member.Read.Group` (Application)
- `Owner.Read.Group` (Application)
- `ChannelSettings.Read.Group` (Application)
- `TeamMember.Read.Group` (Application)
- `TeamSettings.Read.Group` (Application)

**For group chats:**

- `ChatMessage.Read.Chat` (Application) - receive all group chat messages without @mention

## Example Teams Manifest (redacted)

Minimal, valid example with the required fields. Replace IDs and URLs.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/json-schemas/teams/v1.23/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
  "manifestVersion": "1.23",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "name": { "short": "OpenClaw" },
  "developer": {
    "name": "Your Org",
    "websiteUrl": "https://example.com",
    "privacyUrl": "https://example.com/privacy",
    "termsOfUseUrl": "https://example.com/terms"
  },
  "description": { "short": "OpenClaw in Teams", "full": "OpenClaw in Teams" },
  "icons": { "outline": "outline.png", "color": "color.png" },
  "accentColor": "#5B6DEF",
  "bots": [
    {
      "botId": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
      "scopes": ["personal", "team", "groupChat"],
      "isNotificationOnly": false,
      "supportsCalling": false,
      "supportsVideo": false,
      "supportsFiles": true
    }
  ],
  "webApplicationInfo": {
    "id": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
  },
  "authorization": {
    "permissions": {
      "resourceSpecific": [
        { "name": "ChannelMessage.Read.Group", "type": "Application" },
        { "name": "ChannelMessage.Send.Group", "type": "Application" },
        { "name": "Member.Read.Group", "type": "Application" },
        { "name": "Owner.Read.Group", "type": "Application" },
        { "name": "ChannelSettings.Read.Group", "type": "Application" },
        { "name": "TeamMember.Read.Group", "type": "Application" },
        { "name": "TeamSettings.Read.Group", "type": "Application" },
        { "name": "ChatMessage.Read.Chat", "type": "Application" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Manifest caveats (must-have fields)

- `bots[].botId` **must** match the Azure Bot App ID.
- `webApplicationInfo.id` **must** match the Azure Bot App ID.
- `bots[].scopes` must include the surfaces you plan to use (`personal`, `team`, `groupChat`).
- `bots[].supportsFiles: true` is required for file handling in personal scope.
- `authorization.permissions.resourceSpecific` must include channel read/send if you want channel traffic.

### Updating an existing app

To update an already-installed Teams app (e.g., to add RSC permissions):

1. Update your `manifest.json` with the new settings
2. **Increment the `version` field** (e.g., `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`)
3. **Re-zip** the manifest with icons (`manifest.json`, `outline.png`, `color.png`)
4. Upload the new zip:
   - **Option A (Teams Admin Center):** Teams Admin Center → Teams apps → Manage apps → find your app → Upload new version
   - **Option B (Sideload):** In Teams → Apps → Manage your apps → Upload a custom app
5. **For team channels:** Reinstall the app in each team for new permissions to take effect
6. **Fully quit and relaunch Teams** (not just close the window) to clear cached app metadata

## Capabilities: RSC only vs Graph

### With **Teams RSC only** (app installed, no Graph API permissions)

Works:

- Read channel message **text** content.
- Send channel message **text** content.
- Receive **personal (DM)** file attachments.

Does NOT work:

- Channel/group **image or file contents** (payload only includes HTML stub).
- Downloading attachments stored in SharePoint/OneDrive.
- Reading message history (beyond the live webhook event).

### With **Teams RSC + Microsoft Graph Application permissions**

Adds:

- Downloading hosted contents (images pasted into messages).
- Downloading file attachments stored in SharePoint/OneDrive.
- Reading channel/chat message history via Graph.

### RSC vs Graph API

| Capability              | RSC Permissions      | Graph API                           |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Real-time messages**  | Yes (via webhook)    | No (polling only)                   |
| **Historical messages** | No                   | Yes (can query history)             |
| **Setup complexity**    | App manifest only    | Requires admin consent + token flow |
| **Works offline**       | No (must be running) | Yes (query anytime)                 |

**Bottom line:** RSC is for real-time listening; Graph API is for historical access. For catching up on missed messages while offline, you need Graph API with `ChannelMessage.Read.All` (requires admin consent).

## Graph-enabled media + history (required for channels)

If you need images/files in **channels** or want to fetch **message history**, you must enable Microsoft Graph permissions and grant admin consent.

1. In Entra ID (Azure AD) **App Registration**, add Microsoft Graph **Application permissions**:
   - `ChannelMessage.Read.All` (channel attachments + history)
   - `Chat.Read.All` or `ChatMessage.Read.All` (group chats)
2. **Grant admin consent** for the tenant.
3. Bump the Teams app **manifest version**, re-upload, and **reinstall the app in Teams**.
4. **Fully quit and relaunch Teams** to clear cached app metadata.

## Known Limitations

### Webhook timeouts

Teams delivers messages via HTTP webhook. If processing takes too long (e.g., slow LLM responses), you may see:

- Gateway timeouts
- Teams retrying the message (causing duplicates)
- Dropped replies

OpenClaw handles this by returning quickly and sending replies proactively, but very slow responses may still cause issues.

### Formatting

Teams markdown is more limited than Slack or Discord:

- Basic formatting works: **bold**, _italic_, `code`, links
- Complex markdown (tables, nested lists) may not render correctly
- Adaptive Cards are supported for polls and arbitrary card sends (see below)

## Configuration

Key settings (see `/gateway/configuration` for shared channel patterns):

- `channels.msteams.enabled`: enable/disable the channel.
- `channels.msteams.appId`, `channels.msteams.appPassword`, `channels.msteams.tenantId`: bot credentials.
- `channels.msteams.webhook.port` (default `3978`)
- `channels.msteams.webhook.path` (default `/api/messages`)
- `channels.msteams.dmPolicy`: `pairing | allowlist | open | disabled` (default: pairing)
- `channels.msteams.allowFrom`: allowlist for DMs (AAD object IDs, UPNs, or display names). The wizard resolves names to IDs during setup when Graph access is available.
- `channels.msteams.textChunkLimit`: outbound text chunk size.
- `channels.msteams.chunkMode`: `length` (default) or `newline` to split on blank lines (paragraph boundaries) before length chunking.
- `channels.msteams.mediaAllowHosts`: allowlist for inbound attachment hosts (defaults to Microsoft/Teams domains).
- `channels.msteams.mediaAuthAllowHosts`: allowlist for attaching Authorization headers on media retries (defaults to Graph + Bot Framework hosts).
- `channels.msteams.requireMention`: require @mention in channels/groups (default true).
- `channels.msteams.replyStyle`: `thread | top-level` (see [Reply Style](#reply-style-threads-vs-posts)).
- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.replyStyle`: per-team override.
- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.requireMention`: per-team override.
- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.tools`: default per-team tool policy overrides (`allow`/`deny`/`alsoAllow`) used when a channel override is missing.
- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.toolsBySender`: default per-team per-sender tool policy overrides (`"*"` wildcard supported).
- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.channels.<conversationId>.replyStyle`: per-channel override.
- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.channels.<conversationId>.requireMention`: per-channel override.
- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.channels.<conversationId>.tools`: per-channel tool policy overrides (`allow`/`deny`/`alsoAllow`).
- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.channels.<conversationId>.toolsBySender`: per-channel per-sender tool policy overrides (`"*"` wildcard supported).
- `channels.msteams.sharePointSiteId`: SharePoint site ID for file uploads in group chats/channels (see [Sending files in group chats](#sending-files-in-group-chats)).

## Routing & Sessions

- Session keys follow the standard agent format (see [/concepts/session](/concepts/session)):
  - Direct messages share the main session (`agent:<agentId>:<mainKey>`).
  - Channel/group messages use conversation id:
    - `agent:<agentId>:msteams:channel:<conversationId>`
    - `agent:<agentId>:msteams:group:<conversationId>`

## Reply Style: Threads vs Posts

Teams recently introduced two channel UI styles over the same underlying data model:

| Style                    | Description                                               | Recommended `replyStyle` |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Posts** (classic)      | Messages appear as cards with threaded replies underneath | `thread` (default)       |
| **Threads** (Slack-like) | Messages flow linearly, more like Slack                   | `top-level`              |

**The problem:** The Teams API does not expose which UI style a channel uses. If you use the wrong `replyStyle`:

- `thread` in a Threads-style channel → replies appear nested awkwardly
- `top-level` in a Posts-style channel → replies appear as separate top-level posts instead of in-thread

**Solution:** Configure `replyStyle` per-channel based on how the channel is set up:

```json
{
  "msteams": {
    "replyStyle": "thread",
    "teams": {
      "19:abc...@thread.tacv2": {
        "channels": {
          "19:xyz...@thread.tacv2": {
            "replyStyle": "top-level"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Attachments & Images

**Current limitations:**

- **DMs:** Images and file attachments work via Teams bot file APIs.
- **Channels/groups:** Attachments live in M365 storage (SharePoint/OneDrive). The webhook payload only includes an HTML stub, not the actual file bytes. **Graph API permissions are required** to download channel attachments.

Without Graph permissions, channel messages with images will be received as text-only (the image content is not accessible to the bot).
By default, OpenClaw only downloads media from Microsoft/Teams hostnames. Override with `channels.msteams.mediaAllowHosts` (use `["*"]` to allow any host).
Authorization headers are only attached for hosts in `channels.msteams.mediaAuthAllowHosts` (defaults to Graph + Bot Framework hosts). Keep this list strict (avoid multi-tenant suffixes).

## Sending files in group chats

Bots can send files in DMs using the FileConsentCard flow (built-in). However, **sending files in group chats/channels** requires additional setup:

| Context                  | How files are sent                           | Setup needed                                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **DMs**                  | FileConsentCard → user accepts → bot uploads | Works out of the box                            |
| **Group chats/channels** | Upload to SharePoint → share link            | Requires `sharePointSiteId` + Graph permissions |
| **Images (any context)** | Base64-encoded inline                        | Works out of the box                            |

### Why group chats need SharePoint

Bots don't have a personal OneDrive drive (the `/me/drive` Graph API endpoint doesn't work for application identities). To send files in group chats/channels, the bot uploads to a **SharePoint site** and creates a sharing link.

### Setup

1. **Add Graph API permissions** in Entra ID (Azure AD) → App Registration:
   - `Sites.ReadWrite.All` (Application) - upload files to SharePoint
   - `Chat.Read.All` (Application) - optional, enables per-user sharing links

2. **Grant admin consent** for the tenant.

3. **Get your SharePoint site ID:**

   ```bash
   # Via Graph Explorer or curl with a valid token:
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/{hostname}:/{site-path}"

   # Example: for a site at "contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/BotFiles"
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/contoso.sharepoint.com:/sites/BotFiles"

   # Response includes: "id": "contoso.sharepoint.com,guid1,guid2"
   ```

4. **Configure OpenClaw:**
   ```json5
   {
     channels: {
       msteams: {
         // ... other config ...
         sharePointSiteId: "contoso.sharepoint.com,guid1,guid2",
       },
     },
   }
   ```

### Sharing behavior

| Permission                              | Sharing behavior                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Sites.ReadWrite.All` only              | Organization-wide sharing link (anyone in org can access) |
| `Sites.ReadWrite.All` + `Chat.Read.All` | Per-user sharing link (only chat members can access)      |

Per-user sharing is more secure as only the chat participants can access the file. If `Chat.Read.All` permission is missing, the bot falls back to organization-wide sharing.

### Fallback behavior

| Scenario                                          | Result                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Group chat + file + `sharePointSiteId` configured | Upload to SharePoint, send sharing link            |
| Group chat + file + no `sharePointSiteId`         | Attempt OneDrive upload (may fail), send text only |
| Personal chat + file                              | FileConsentCard flow (works without SharePoint)    |
| Any context + image                               | Base64-encoded inline (works without SharePoint)   |

### Files stored location

Uploaded files are stored in a `/OpenClawShared/` folder in the configured SharePoint site's default document library.

## Polls (Adaptive Cards)

OpenClaw sends Teams polls as Adaptive Cards (there is no native Teams poll API).

- CLI: `openclaw message poll --channel msteams --target conversation:<id> ...`
- Votes are recorded by the gateway in `~/.openclaw/msteams-polls.json`.
- The gateway must stay online to record votes.
- Polls do not auto-post result summaries yet (inspect the store file if needed).

## Adaptive Cards (arbitrary)

Send any Adaptive Card JSON to Teams users or conversations using the `message` tool or CLI.

The `card` parameter accepts an Adaptive Card JSON object. When `card` is provided, the message text is optional.

**Agent tool:**

```json
{
  "action": "send",
  "channel": "msteams",
  "target": "user:<id>",
  "card": {
    "type": "AdaptiveCard",
    "version": "1.5",

  }
}
```

**CLI:**

```bash
openclaw message send --channel msteams \
  --target "conversation:19:abc...@thread.tacv2" \

```

See [Adaptive Cards documentation](https://adaptivecards.io/) for card schema and examples. For target format details, see [Target formats](#target-formats) below.

## Target formats

MSTeams targets use prefixes to distinguish between users and conversations:

| Target type         | Format                           | Example                                             |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| User (by ID)        | `user:<aad-object-id>`           | `user:40a1a0ed-4ff2-4164-a219-55518990c197`         |
| User (by name)      | `user:<display-name>`            | `user:John Smith` (requires Graph API)              |
| Group/channel       | `conversation:<conversation-id>` | `conversation:19:abc123...@thread.tacv2`            |
| Group/channel (raw) | `<conversation-id>`              | `19:abc123...@thread.tacv2` (if contains `@thread`) |

**CLI examples:**

```bash
# Send to a user by ID
openclaw message send --channel msteams --target "user:40a1a0ed-..." --message "Hello"

# Send to a user by display name (triggers Graph API lookup)
openclaw message send --channel msteams --target "user:John Smith" --message "Hello"

# Send to a group chat or channel
openclaw message send --channel msteams --target "conversation:19:abc...@thread.tacv2" --message "Hello"

# Send an Adaptive Card to a conversation
openclaw message send --channel msteams --target "conversation:19:abc...@thread.tacv2" \
  --card '{"type":"AdaptiveCard","version":"1.5","body":[{"type":"TextBlock","text":"Hello"}]}'
```

**Agent tool examples:**

```json
{
  "action": "send",
  "channel": "msteams",
  "target": "user:John Smith",
  "message": "Hello!"
}
```

```json
{
  "action": "send",
  "channel": "msteams",
  "target": "conversation:19:abc...@thread.tacv2",
  "card": {
    "type": "AdaptiveCard",
    "version": "1.5",
    "body": [{ "type": "TextBlock", "text": "Hello" }]
  }
}
```

Note: Without the `user:` prefix, names default to group/team resolution. Always use `user:` when targeting people by display name.

## Proactive messaging

- Proactive messages are only possible **after** a user has interacted, because we store conversation references at that point.
- See `/gateway/configuration` for `dmPolicy` and allowlist gating.

## Team and Channel IDs (Common Gotcha)

The `groupId` query parameter in Teams URLs is **NOT** the team ID used for configuration. Extract IDs from the URL path instead:

**Team URL:**

```
https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3ABk4j...%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=...
                                    └────────────────────────────┘
                                    Team ID (URL-decode this)
```

**Channel URL:**

```
https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A15bc...%40thread.tacv2/ChannelName?groupId=...
                                      └─────────────────────────┘
                                      Channel ID (URL-decode this)
```

**For config:**

- Team ID = path segment after `/team/` (URL-decoded, e.g., `19:Bk4j...@thread.tacv2`)
- Channel ID = path segment after `/channel/` (URL-decoded)
- **Ignore** the `groupId` query parameter

## Private Channels

Bots have limited support in private channels:

| Feature                      | Standard Channels | Private Channels       |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Bot installation             | Yes               | Limited                |
| Real-time messages (webhook) | Yes               | May not work           |
| RSC permissions              | Yes               | May behave differently |
| @mentions                    | Yes               | If bot is accessible   |
| Graph API history            | Yes               | Yes (with permissions) |

**Workarounds if private channels don't work:**

1. Use standard channels for bot interactions
2. Use DMs - users can always message the bot directly
3. Use Graph API for historical access (requires `ChannelMessage.Read.All`)

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

- **Images not showing in channels:** Graph permissions or admin consent missing. Reinstall the Teams app and fully quit/reopen Teams.
- **No responses in channel:** mentions are required by default; set `channels.msteams.requireMention=false` or configure per team/channel.
- **Version mismatch (Teams still shows old manifest):** remove + re-add the app and fully quit Teams to refresh.
- **401 Unauthorized from webhook:** Expected when testing manually without Azure JWT - means endpoint is reachable but auth failed. Use Azure Web Chat to test properly.

### Manifest upload errors

- **"Icon file cannot be empty":** The manifest references icon files that are 0 bytes. Create valid PNG icons (32x32 for `outline.png`, 192x192 for `color.png`).
- **"webApplicationInfo.Id already in use":** The app is still installed in another team/chat. Find and uninstall it first, or wait 5-10 minutes for propagation.
- **"Something went wrong" on upload:** Upload via https://admin.teams.microsoft.com instead, open browser DevTools (F12) → Network tab, and check the response body for the actual error.
- **Sideload failing:** Try "Upload an app to your org's app catalog" instead of "Upload a custom app" - this often bypasses sideload restrictions.

### RSC permissions not working

1. Verify `webApplicationInfo.id` matches your bot's App ID exactly
2. Re-upload the app and reinstall in the team/chat
3. Check if your org admin has blocked RSC permissions
4. Confirm you're using the right scope: `ChannelMessage.Read.Group` for teams, `ChatMessage.Read.Chat` for group chats
